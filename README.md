## HouseMarketAnalysis - Housing Market Analysis Project

## Overview
* This project analyzes real estate data to predict property prices using linear regression.

## Dataset
* It utilizes a real estate dataset ('kc_house_data.csv') with features like square footage and bedrooms.

## Steps
- 1. Load data and explore.
- 2. Preprocess data (drop columns, handle missing values).
- 3. Train a linear regression model to predict prices.
- 4. Evaluate model using R-squared score.

## Prerequisites
* Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib.

## Usage
- 1. Clone the repository.
- 2. Install required libraries with 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
- 3. Run the Jupyter notebook or script.

## Results
* The linear regression model achieves an R-squared score of 0.5105.

## Conclusion
* This project offers insights for real estate decisions based on property features and price predictions.
